description: Lecture summary, written by a student. The focus of this lecture is to
  review emission and absorption spectra by looking at the theoretical projection
  of the Earth?s spectra and how it changed over time. The central concept of this
  class is to determine whether scientists can draw conclusions about alien life based
  on spectra of exoplanets and what considerations should be made when discussing
  "life" and its components.
